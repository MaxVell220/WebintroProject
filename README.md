Rejuvenation Technologies: If this startup gets its way, it’ll make it so we all live longer. Through extending the protective cap of DNA that functions as an aging clock, called telomeres, Rejuvenation Technologies aims to reverse aging. Rejuvenation’s drug extends telomeres and is already testing in animals, and says that one dose given to a mouse appeared to turn back the clock the equivalent of five years in humans. The founders envision a world where people take the drug to extend their healthspan and lifespans.
